# RestaurantEntrepreneur
This project is meant to simulate tracking sales data from multiple restaurant locations. The end result will be a console application that writes information to a .txt file. When the user runs the console app, it will display several messages prompting the user to order an item from a restaurant location, one at a time, to simulate a dayâ€™s business. After the orders are concluded, the results will be logged to the log.txt file, tracking the total number and dollar value of the combined sales.   Note that the log.txt can be cleared out routinely during the testing/development process, since it will retain information from all previous times the program ran.
